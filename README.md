# to_do_website

ToDo List website made with HTML, CSS & JS.

Had a lot of hands-on experience with creating interactivity on the page while also trying to create a decent design and UX.
I also learned that it's always best to create the mobile layout first :P (had some work to do on the responsive side).

All in all a great experience, hope to create an updated version of this soon.
